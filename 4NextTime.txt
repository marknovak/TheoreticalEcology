Syllabus: Second 1D stability analysis (? check) is actually "catch-up day", so rename it as such.

Drop Quiz 3 & PS 3 (and renumber all others)

Drop Lectures 5 & 6 (process vs. obs. error, and model-fitting) along with associated Paper discussions of AIC.  Replace with material at the end of the course.

Reread PS#2 and try clarify what actually needs to be done vs. what is new information to learn.
Fix PS2 to be explicit about what expectations are being taken over.

Rearrange Class 10 Competition to have R code demonstrations come after all of graphical analysis and drawing on board

Replace Tanya Rogers (chaos is common) paper for Hassell et al.

Spend longer teaching Mathematica in class.

Anticipate more time (2nd whole class period) for Trophic modules, such that we can in fact do them in class together.

Interaction Strengths (and then Press perturbations) is an okay class to skip.
