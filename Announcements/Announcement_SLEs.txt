Not that this has anything to do with the previous announcement (ha ha ha, the timing is pretty perfect though, isn't it), but...

You may have noticed a new link appear in the lefthand menu of our Canvas homepage:  "Student Learning Experience".    Yup, the time for filling out these SLE forms (formerly known as eSETs) is upon us.

We're going to devote the last part of our last class to talking about how the course went for everyone (i.e. that's where we help each other realize how far we've each come, and where I most often really get your feedback and suggestions for how to improve the course).  Nonetheless, these SLEs are extremely useful to me in justifying the course (and my teaching style for it) to my colleagues and higher-ups.  (It's not necessarily a given that I will get to teach it again!)  It's huge even just to be able to show that 100% of you took the time to fill out the form.

Please, therefore, take the few minutes (or as long as you need to give me your feedback) to answer the questions for the course.  The window for doing so closes December 10th, 11:59pm, but please don't leave it so late that you forget.

Thanks!
